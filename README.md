Music website name celestia

  I designed to use my lab5 (music theme) to compare the difference between styling on my own and styling by using Bootstrap. It turns out that using Bootstrap is convenient 
but it has a lot of new keywords for styling such as margin - ms,pe-lg,col-md, etc. Moreover, in terms of responsive, I am also convenient as well but I still struggle with some parts
that do not turn out as I wanted. For example, I can not just use ms because it will affect the mobile interface too. I tried to use the carousel to make my card 
slide but it was not working and I gave up on that but will try it later on another project. In terms of design, I start with finding a logo first. Then, choosing the colors
mood, and tone to match with it to give the same vibe.
